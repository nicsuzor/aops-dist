# /pull - Pull, Claim, and Complete a Task

**Purpose**: Get a task from the ready queue, claim it (mark status active), and mark it complete when finished.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get and Claim a Task

1. **List ready tasks**: Call `mcp__pkb__list_tasks(status="active", limit=10)` to find ready tasks.
2. **Select task**: Review the list and select the highest priority task (lowest priority number, e.g., P0).
3. **Claim task**: Call `mcp__pkb__update_task(id="<task-id>", status="in_progress", assignee="polecat")` to claim it.

**If a specific task ID is provided** (`/pull <task-id>`):

1. Call `mcp__pkb__get_task(id="<task-id>")` to load it.
2. If the task has children (leaf=false), navigate to the first ready leaf subtask instead.
3. Claim with `mcp__pkb__update_task(id="<task-id>", status="in_progress", assignee="polecat")`.

**If no tasks are ready**:

- Check active/inbox tasks for any that can be worked on.
- If none exist, report and halt.

### Step 1.5: Inject Soft Dependency Context (Advisory)

After claiming, check if the task has `soft_depends_on` relationships:

1. Read the task's `soft_depends_on` array
2. For each soft dependency ID:
   - Call `mcp__pkb__get_task(id="<soft-dep-id>")`
   - If status is `done`, extract the task body for context
   - If status is NOT done, log: "Soft dependency <id> not yet complete - proceeding without context"
3. Present completed soft dependency context before execution:

```markdown
## Soft Dependency Context (Advisory)

The following completed tasks provide informational context for this task:

### [<soft-dep-id>] <title>

<body excerpt or summary>

---
```

**Important**: Soft dependencies are ADVISORY only:

- Reading them is recommended but not mandatory
- Missing/incomplete soft deps do NOT block task execution
- Context injection helps but agent can proceed without it

### Step 2: Assess Task Path - EXECUTE or TRIAGE

After claiming, determine whether to execute immediately or triage first.

#### EXECUTE Path (all must be true)

Proceed with execution when:

- **What**: Task describes specific deliverable(s)
- **Where**: Target files/systems are known or locatable within 5 minutes
- **Why**: Context is sufficient for implementation decisions
- **How**: Steps are known or determinable from codebase/docs
- **Scope**: Estimated completion within current session
- **Blockers**: No external dependencies (human approval, external input, waiting)

→ Proceed to Step 3: Execute

#### TRIAGE Path (any is true)

Triage instead of executing when:

- Task requires human judgment/approval
- Task has unknowns requiring exploration beyond this session
- Task is too vague to determine deliverables
- Task depends on external input not yet available
- Task exceeds session scope

→ Proceed to Step 3: Triage

### Step 3A: Execute (EXECUTE Path)

Follow the task's workflow or use standard execution pattern:

1. Read task body for context and acceptance criteria
2. Implement the changes
3. **Verify with independent evidence** (see Step 3A.V below)
4. Run tests if applicable
5. Commit changes
6. Complete task (see Step 4)

### Step 3A.V: Verification Loop (P#103)

Before proceeding to commit, verify the work produces **independent evidence** of correctness. Verification depth scales with complexity:

**Simple tasks** (typo, config change, single-file edit):
- Run tests. If they pass, proceed.

**Standard tasks** (feature, refactor, straightforward bug):
- Run tests AND manually verify the change does what the acceptance criteria require.

**Complex tasks** (concurrency bugs, multi-component fixes, inherited work from other sessions):
- Independently trace the causal chain: what was broken → why → does this fix address the actual mechanism?
- Do NOT trust prior documentation at face value. Re-derive the conclusion from code.
- If inheriting work: the previous session's analysis is a hypothesis, not a fact. Verify it.

**QA loop**: If verification reveals gaps or doubts, loop back to step 2. Do NOT proceed to commit with unresolved questions. This loop is the difference between "tests pass" and "fix is correct."

### Step 3A.1: Execute Spike/Learn Tasks

For tasks with `type: learn`:

1. **Investigate** per task instructions
2. **Write findings to task body** - Use `update_task(id, body=...)` to append findings
3. **Summarize in parent epic** - Read parent, append to "## Findings from Spikes"
4. **Apply learnings to framework** - Before creating follow-up tasks, check if findings warrant direct changes to framework files (HEURISTICS.md, skill prompts, specs). Knowledge files alone are insufficient — if a learning points to a process improvement, change the process.
5. **Decompose actionable items** - Create subtasks for remaining work that can't be done in this session:
   ```
   mcp__pkb__create_task(
     id="<spike-id>",
     children=[
       {"title": "[Fix] Issue 1", "type": "task", "body": "Context from spike..."},
       {"title": "[Fix] Issue 2", "type": "task", "body": "Context from spike..."}
     ]
   )
   ```
6. **Complete the spike** - Decomposition IS completion for learn tasks (per P#71, P#81)

### Step 3A.2: Commit Before Completion

Before marking task complete, verify work is committed:

1. Run `git status` - should show no uncommitted changes to tracked files
2. If uncommitted changes exist:
   - Stage relevant files: `git add <files>`
   - Commit with task context: `git commit -m "feat(<area>): <task summary>"`
3. Only after commit succeeds, proceed to Step 4

**Enforcement**: Do NOT call `complete_task()` until commit is verified.

### Step 3B: Triage (TRIAGE Path)

Take appropriate action based on what's needed:

#### Option A: Assign to Role

If task needs specific expertise or human judgment:

```
mcp__pkb__update_task(
  id="<task-id>",
  assignee="<role>"  # e.g., "nic", "polecat"
)
```

**Role assignment logic:**

- `assignee="nic"` - Requires human judgment, strategic decisions, or external context
- `assignee="polecat"` - Can be automated but needs clarification on scope/approach
- Leave unassigned if role unclear

Note: Use `mcp__pkb__update_task` (not `mcp__plugin_aops-core_tasks`) for assignee support. Don't set status to "blocked" - just assign.

#### Option B: Decompose into Subtasks

If task is too large but scope is clear:

**Architecture checkpoint (required for >3 subtasks)**: Before creating subtasks, present the architectural approach to the user — what you plan to build, how (agent prompts vs code, which patterns), and key tradeoffs. Do NOT create subtasks until the approach is confirmed. Premature decomposition before the design is stable creates waste (P#72).

```
mcp__pkb__create_task(
  id="<parent-id>",
  children=[
    {"title": "Subtask 1: [specific action]", "type": "action", "order": 0},
    {"title": "Subtask 2: [specific action]", "type": "action", "order": 1},
    {"title": "Subtask 3: [specific action]", "type": "action", "order": 2}
  ]
)
```

**Subtask explosion heuristics:**

- Each subtask should pass EXECUTE criteria (15-60 min, clear deliverable)
- Break by natural boundaries: files, features, or dependencies
- Order subtasks logically (dependencies first)
- Don't over-decompose: 3-7 subtasks is ideal
- If > 7 subtasks needed, create intermediate grouping tasks

#### Option C: Block for Clarification

If task is fundamentally unclear:

```
mcp__pkb__update_task(
  id="<task-id>",
  status="blocked",
  body="Blocked: [specific questions]. Context: [what's known so far]."
)
```

After triaging, **HALT** - do not proceed to execution. The task is now either assigned, decomposed, or blocked.

### Step 4: Finish and Mark Ready for Merge

After successful execution (EXECUTE path only), finalize the task:

#### If in a Polecat Worktree

Detect via: current directory is under `~/.aops/polecat/` or `$POLECAT_HOME/polecat/`

Run `polecat finish` via Bash:

```bash
polecat finish
```

This command:

1. Auto-commits any uncommitted changes (safeguard)
2. Pushes the branch to origin
3. Attempts to create/update a PR (best-effort; requires GitHub CLI `gh` and may fail without aborting)
4. Sets task status to `merge_ready` (even if PR creation/update fails)

The PR review pipeline handles merge via GitHub auto-merge when a PR exists and is configured appropriately.

#### If NOT in a Polecat Worktree

For tasks executed outside the polecat worktree system (e.g., direct `/pull` in a normal repo), use:

```
mcp__pkb__complete_task(id="<task-id>")
```

This directly marks the task as `done` since there's no branch to merge.

**Note**: TRIAGE path should halt before reaching Step 4. Only EXECUTE path tasks should be finished.

## Arguments

- `/pull` - Get highest priority ready task and claim it
- `/pull <task-id>` - Claim a specific task (or its first ready leaf if it has children)

## Implementation Note

How you execute the task, how you verify it, how you commit/push—those are agent responsibilities, not `/pull` responsibilities. This skill just manages the queue state: get, claim, complete.
