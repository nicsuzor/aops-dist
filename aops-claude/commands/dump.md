# /dump - Session Handover & Context Dump

Force graceful handover when work must stop or session must end. This unified command ensures clean session closure and context preservation.

## Usage

```
/dump
```

This command is **mandatory** before session end. The framework stop gate blocks exit until `/dump` is invoked and completed.

## When to Use

- Session ending normally (replaces `/handover`)
- Session must end unexpectedly (Emergency)
- Context window approaching limit
- User needs to interrupt for higher-priority work
- Agent is stuck and needs to hand off

## Execution

Execute the following steps in order. Execute the [[handover-workflow]] if further guidance is needed.

### Step 1: Commit All Work (MANDATORY)

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**You MUST commit and PUSH all your work before ending the session.** This is non-negotiable per P#24 (No Commit Hesitation).

- **Staged changes**: Commit immediately with descriptive message
- **Unstaged changes**: Stage and commit ALL relevant files
- **No exceptions**: Work that isn't committed is lost

> **CRITICAL**: Do not proceed to Step 2 until ALL changes are committed and pushed. The only acceptable reason to skip committing is if you made NO file changes this session.

### Step 2: Update Task & Capture Outstanding Work

1. **Identify current task**: (or create historical task if work was done without one)
2. **Update task with progress checkpoint**:
   ```
   mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__update_task(id="<task-id>", status="in_progress", body="## Progress Checkpoint\n...")
   ```
3. **File follow-up tasks for ANY outstanding work**:
   - **Revealed errors/warnings** - Problems discovered but not fixed (e.g., lint errors, CI failures)
   - **Incomplete work** - Planned steps that weren't completed
   - **Deferred decisions** - Items marked for later
   - **Verification gaps** - Tests that should be run

   **For EACH item, call `mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__create_task()` with details.** Mentioning follow-up in reflection text is NOT sufficient; tasks must exist in the system before proceeding.

### Step 3: Persist Discoveries to Memory (Optional)

If significant discoveries or learnings occurred, persist them to memory:
```
mcp__memory__store_memory(content="...", tags=["dump", "handover"])
```

### Step 4: Output Framework Reflection

Output the following structure **exactly** (the framework validates this format):

```markdown
## Framework Reflection

**Outcome**: success|partial|failure
**Accomplishments**: [What was completed this session]
**Friction points**: [Issues encountered, or "none"]
**Next step**: [Task IDs for follow-up work, or "none"]
```

**Field definitions**:

- **Outcome**:
  - `success` - All planned work completed
  - `partial` - Some work completed, some deferred (Standard for Emergency Dump)
  - `failure` - Unable to complete primary objective
- **Accomplishments**: Brief bullet points of what was done
- **Friction points**: Framework issues, tool problems, blockers, or "none"
- **Next step**: Task IDs from Step 2 (e.g., `aops-abc123`), or "none" if no follow-up needed

### Step 5: Confirm Handover Complete

After outputting the reflection, state:

```
Handover complete. Session may now end.
```

This confirms to the user and the stop gate that the handover procedure completed.

### Step 6: Halt

After confirming handover, **stop working**. Do not start new tasks or attempt to fix remaining issues.

> **CRITICAL**: The reflection MUST confirm that changes were committed in Step 1. Never output a reflection with uncommitted work.
