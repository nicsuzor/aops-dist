# Prove Feature
<!-- NS: this is just the QA skill/feature/command. consolidate -->
<!-- @claude 2026-02-07: Agreed. prove-feature overlaps with /qa skill. QA skill does end-to-end verification; prove-feature is framework-integration specific. Consolidating into QA skill with optional --framework flag would reduce duplication. Task created: aops-d915f7fd. -->
Validate framework integration. "Does it integrate correctly?"

## Routing Signals

- Validating new framework capabilities
- Verifying structural changes (relationships, computed fields)
- "Does it connect properly?"

## NOT This Workflow

- General functionality testing → [[qa-demo]]
- Unit testing → [[tdd-cycle]]
- Bug investigation → [[debugging]]

## Unique Steps

1. **Baseline**: Capture state before running feature
2. **Execute**: Run feature as user would
3. **Verify**: Check structural changes
4. **Report**: Evidence table (expected vs actual)

## Evidence Format

| Field | Expected | Actual | Correct? |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| [key] | [value]  | [value]| ✅/❌    |
