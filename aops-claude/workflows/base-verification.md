# Base: Verification

**Composable base pattern.** Most workflows include this. Avoids shifting goalposts during work.

## Pattern

1. BEFORE starting work, lock in clear, testable ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
...[ after work ] ...
2. Confirm according to evidence gathered (tests pass, behavior observed, output verified) against locked ORIGINAL criteria.

## Escalation

If verification reveals issues:
- Simple fix → fix and re-verify
- Complex issue → switch to [[debugging]]
