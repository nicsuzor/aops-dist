# Excalidraw Productivity Tips (2025 Best Practices)

## Essential Shortcuts & Techniques

### 1. Snapping for Precision

- Enable object snapping: `Alt/Option + S`
- Snaps to anchor points, centers, edges
- Essential for professional alignment
- Combine with grid (`Cmd/Ctrl + '`) for pixel-perfect layouts

### 2. Multi-Point Arrows for Clean Paths

- Click-click-click (not click-drag) to create arrows
- Creates precise control points
- Easier to adjust later
- Produces cleaner, more intentional paths
- Hold Ctrl/Cmd to prevent auto-binding when needed

### 3. Duplicate with Connection

- `Cmd/Ctrl + D` → Duplicate element
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow` → Duplicate AND connect with arrow in that direction
- Massive time-saver for flowcharts and sequential diagrams

### 4. Stats for Nerds (Alt + /)

- Shows exact pixel dimensions of selected elements
- Use to match sizes across elements precisely
- Essential for maintaining proportions
- Great for creating pixel-perfect UI designs

### 5. Link Elements to External Resources

- Select element → `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → Add URL
- Creates clickable diagrams
- Link to documentation, specs, tickets
- Transform diagrams into interactive navigation tools

### 6. Frame-Based Organization

Multi-frame workflow for complex projects:

- Use rectangular boxes as frames/artboards
- Choose aspect ratio for target use case:
  - 16:9 for presentations
  - 4:3 for documents
  - Custom for web/mobile screens
- Organize complex projects across multiple frames
- Export individual frames separately

### 7. Library Workflow Efficiency

- Create components once, reuse everywhere
- Group elements (`Cmd/Ctrl + G`) before adding to library
- Maintain personal library of commonly-used components
- Load project-specific libraries at start of session

### 8. Minimalist Approach to Slides/Presentations

- Keep slides uncluttered (one key idea per frame)
- Use simple drawings with limited text
- Focus on message, not decoration
- Spread content across multiple frames for clarity

### 9. Binding Arrows to Shapes

- Always bind arrows to shapes (not to canvas coordinates)
- Arrows move with elements during rearrangement
- Maintains relationships automatically
- Hold Ctrl/Cmd to temporarily disable auto-binding

### 10. Copy/Paste Style

- Select element with desired style
- Copy (`Cmd/Ctrl + C`)
- Select target elements
- Paste style → applies colors, stroke, fill without changing position

### 11. Text Editing Efficiency

- Double-click shape → Edit text directly
- Double-click arrow → Add label to arrow
- `Cmd/Ctrl + B` → Toggle bold (if using variable font)
- Resize text container by dragging handles

### 12. Smart Grouping Strategy

- Group related elements for easy movement
- Ungroup when you need to edit individual pieces
- Don't over-group (makes editing harder)
- Use frames instead of groups for large organizational units

## Additional Keyboard Shortcuts

### Layers/Z-order

- `Cmd/Ctrl + ]` → Bring forward
- `Cmd/Ctrl + [` → Send backward
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + ]` → Bring to front
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + [` → Send to back

### View Controls

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Wheel` → Zoom in/out
- `Space + Drag` → Pan canvas
- `Cmd/Ctrl + 0` → Reset zoom to 100%
- `Cmd/Ctrl + 1` → Zoom to fit all elements

### Selection

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Click` → Add to selection
- Hold `Shift` while resizing → Maintain aspect ratio

### Drawing Tools

- `X` → Freedraw tool
- `E` → Eraser
- `Cmd/Ctrl + G` → Group selection
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + G` → Ungroup
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → Add link to selected element
