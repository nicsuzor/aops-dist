# Mind Mapping Design Principles

Mind maps and concept maps are powerful tools for organizing information hierarchically and showing relationships. Apply these four fundamental design principles (adapted from "The Non-Designer's Design Book"):

## 1. Proximity - Group Related Information Visually

**What**: Elements that are related should be visually close together

**How**:

- Cluster similar/related ideas using boundaries or frames
- Apply same color family to related groups
- Use consistent spacing within groups (20-40px)
- Separate unrelated groups with larger gaps (80-120px)

**Why**: Proximity creates implicit relationships without explicit connections

**Example**: All tasks for Project A clustered together, separate from Project B tasks

## 2. Alignment - Everything Aligns to a Benchmark

**What**: No element should be placed arbitrarily on the canvas

**How**:

- Align child nodes to parent nodes (centered, or edge-aligned)
- Maintain consistent radial spacing in circular layouts
- Use grid snapping for precision (Cmd/Ctrl + ')
- Align text baselines across same-level nodes

**Why**: Alignment organizes complex information and creates visual association

**Example**: All Tier 2 project nodes at same distance from central goal

## 3. Contrast - Differentiate Hierarchy Levels

**What**: Visual differences signal importance and hierarchy

**How**:

- Size: Primary nodes 2-3× larger than secondary nodes
- Color: Saturated = important, desaturated = supporting
- Stroke weight: Thick (3-4px) for major connections, thin (1-2px) for details
- Font size: XL for titles, L for headers, M for body, S for labels
- Shape variation: Circles for goals, rectangles for projects, diamonds for decisions

**Why**: Contrast makes hierarchy immediately visible and guides attention

**Example**: Central goal (XL, saturated blue) vs outer tasks (M, light gray)

## 4. Repetition - Unify Through Consistent Patterns

**What**: Repeated visual elements create coherence and aid understanding

**How**:

- Same color for same category across entire diagram
- Same shape for same element type (all tasks = rectangles)
- Same arrow style for same relationship type
- Consistent spacing ratios throughout
- Matching font sizes for same hierarchy level

**Why**: Repetition connects disparate elements and strengthens pattern recognition

**Example**: All completed tasks use green + 70% opacity consistently

## Applying All Four Principles Together

1. **Proximity**: Group Project A tasks together, Project B tasks together
2. **Alignment**: Center-align all tasks under their project nodes
3. **Contrast**: Project nodes larger and darker than task nodes
4. **Repetition**: All projects use rectangles, all tasks use circles

## Content Guidelines

- **Use keywords/short phrases**: "User Authentication" not "Implement a comprehensive user authentication system with OAuth2"
- **Keep labels concise**: 1-5 words per node label
- **Visual > textual**: Use symbols, icons, colors to convey meaning
- **Avoid paragraphs**: If you need extensive text, link to external document
- **One concept per node**: Split complex ideas into multiple connected nodes
