## Routing Rules

1. **Explicit match**: User says "/daily" or "update my daily" → invoke `/daily` directly
2. **Trigger match**: User request matches trigger phrases → suggest skill, confirm if ambiguous
3. **Context match**: File types or project structure indicate skill → apply skill guidance
4. **No match**: Route through normal workflow selection (WORKFLOWS.md)
