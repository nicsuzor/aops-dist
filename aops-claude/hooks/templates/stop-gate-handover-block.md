<aops-warning>You have stopped calling tools without finishing. Please complete your assigned work.

**When ending a work session**, you MUST invoke the `handover` Skill and follow all required steps.
- It is not sufficient to enact the steps without invoking the `handover` skill -- this will not be recognised by the system.
- Using mutating tools (Edit, Write, Bash, git) after handover will reset this gate and require you to invoke `/handover` again.
