# Daily Note Skill

Manage daily note lifecycle: morning briefing, task recommendations, and session sync.

## Path Resolution

**CRITICAL**: This skill requires the `$ACA_DATA` environment variable to be set.
- `$ACA_DATA` points to the user's data directory (contains daily notes, tasks, etc.)

Location: `$ACA_DATA/daily/YYYYMMDD-daily.md`

## CRITICAL BOUNDARY: Planning Only

**This skill is for PLANNING, not EXECUTION.**

- `/daily` captures priorities in the daily note
- `/daily` does NOT execute tasks, even if user states priorities
- When user answers "what sounds right for today?" → record in Focus section, then COMPLETE
- After daily note is updated: output "Daily planning complete. Use `/pull` to start work." and HALT

**User stating a priority ≠ authorization to execute that priority.**

## Invocation Modes

The daily skill integrates sync into every run to keep the daily note current:

| Mode | Trigger | Sections Run | User Approval |
|------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Morning** | `/daily` (no args, note missing) | 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 (auto-sync) | Required (3.4) |
| **Refresh** | `/daily` (note exists) | 2 → 3 → 4 (auto-sync) | Required (3.4) |
| **Full Sync** | `/daily sync` | 4 only | Required (4.8) |

**Mode Detection Logic:**

```
if args contains "sync":
    mode = "Full Sync"  # Explicit sync-only with approval
elif daily_note_exists():
    mode = "Refresh"    # Briefing update + auto-sync
else:
    mode = "Morning"    # Full creation + auto-sync
```

**Auto-Sync Behavior**: When running Morning or Refresh modes, sync (section 4) runs automatically after section 3 completes. Auto-sync skips the approval step (4.8) to avoid interrupting the flow. Session data is processed and merged silently.

**Full Sync Use Case**: Run `/daily sync` explicitly when you want:
- End-of-day synthesis with user approval of the narrative
- To verify/correct auto-synced content
- To process sessions without re-running email triage

## Section Ownership

| Section                 | Owner    | Updated By             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Focus                   | `/daily` | Morning briefing + task recommendations |
| Task Tree               | `/daily` | Task hierarchy snapshot |
| Today's Story           | `/daily` | Session JSON synthesis |
| FYI                     | `/daily` | Email triage           |
| Session Log/Timeline    | `/daily` | Session JSON synthesis |
| Project Accomplishments | `/daily` | Session JSON synthesis |
| Reflection              | `/daily` | End-of-day sync (Step 4.4.5) |
| Abandoned Todos         | `/daily` | End-of-day             |

## Formatting Rules

1. **No horizontal lines**: Never use `---` as section dividers in generated content (only valid in frontmatter)
2. **Wikilink all names**: Person names, project names, and task titles use `[[wikilink]]` syntax (e.g., `[[Greg Austin]]`, `[[academicOps]]`)
3. **Task IDs**: Always include task IDs when referencing tasks (e.g., `[ns-abc] Task title`)

## 1. Create note

Check `$ACA_DATA/daily/YYYYMMDD-daily.md`.

**If missing**: Create from template (see Daily Note Structure above), then:

1. Read the previous working day's daily note
2. Identify any incomplete tasks and copy to "## Carryover from Yesterday" section
3. Copy "Abandoned Todos" to "## Carryover from Yesterday" section
4. Note overdue items from yesterday's Focus Dashboard

### 1.2: Load Recent Activity

Read last 3 daily notes to show project activity summary:

- Which projects had work recently
- Current state/blockers per project

## 2. Update daily briefing

### 2.0: Load User Context for Email Classification

Before classifying emails, load domain context to filter by relevance:

```bash
Read $ACA_DATA/CORE.md        # User profile, research focus
Read $ACA_DATA/context/strategy.md  # Active projects and domains
```

**Use this context during classification**: Emails about funding, CFPs, conferences, or opportunities OUTSIDE the user's research domains should be classified as **Skip** (domain-irrelevant), not FYI. The user's domains are visible in strategy.md under "Projects" and "Strategic Logic Model".

### 2.1: Email Triage

Fetch recent emails via Outlook MCP:

```
mcp__outlook__messages_list_recent(limit=50, folder="inbox")
```

**CRITICAL - Check sent mail FIRST**: Before classifying ANY inbox email, you MUST fetch sent mail and cross-reference to avoid flagging already-handled items:

```
mcp__outlook__messages_list_recent(limit=20, folder="sent")
```

**For EACH inbox email**: Compare subject line (ignoring Re:/Fwd: prefixes) against sent mail subjects. If a matching sent reply exists, classify as **Skip** (already handled). This cross-reference is MANDATORY - skipping it causes duplicate task creation.

**Classify each email** using [[workflows/triage-email]] criteria (LLM semantic classification, not keyword matching).

### 2.2: FYI Content in Daily Note

**Goal**: User reads FYI content in the daily note itself, not by opening emails.

**Thread grouping**: Group emails by conversation thread (same subject minus Re:/Fwd:). Present threads as unified summaries, not individual emails.

**For each FYI thread/item**, fetch full content with `mcp__outlook__messages_get` and include:

- Thread participants and who said what (if multiple contributors)
- **Actual content**: The key information - quote directly for short emails, summarize for long ones

**Format in briefing**:

```markdown
## FYI

### [Thread Topic]

[Participants] discussed [topic]. [Key content/decision/info].

> [Direct quote if short]

### [Single Email Topic]

From [sender]: [Actual content or summary]
```

**CRITICAL - For each FYI item, IMMEDIATELY after writing it:**
1. **If action required** (feedback, review, response, decision, "review X before Y") → `mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__create_task()` NOW
   - Include deadline if mentioned or implied (e.g., "before Planning Day" = Planning Day date)
   - **Then add task link to FYI content**: `- **→ Task**: [task-id] Task title`
2. **If links to existing task** → `mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__update_task()` with the info
3. **If worth future recall** → `mcp__memory__store_memory()` with tags

Do NOT batch these to a later step. Task creation AND linking happens AS you process each email, not after.

**Archive flow (user confirmation required)**:
1. Present FYI content in daily note (complete section 2.2)
2. **DO NOT offer to archive yet** - user needs time to read and process the content
3. **Wait for user signal** - user will indicate when they've read the content (e.g., responds to the briefing, asks a question, or says "ok" / "got it")
4. Only AFTER user has acknowledged the content, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which to archive
5. Exception: Obvious spam (promotional, irrelevant newsletters) can be offered for archive immediately

**Archiving emails**: Use `messages_move` with `folder_path="Archive"` (not "Deleted Items" - that's trash, not archive). If the Archive folder doesn't exist for an account, ask the user which folder to use.

**Empty state**: If no FYI emails, skip this section.

### 2.3: Verify FYI Persistence (Checkpoint)

Before moving to section 3, verify you completed the inline persistence from 2.2:

- [ ] Each action-requiring FYI has a task created
- [ ] Each created task is linked back in the FYI section (`→ Task: [id]`)
- [ ] Relevant existing tasks updated with new info
- [ ] High-value FYI items stored in memory

**Rule**: Information captured but not persisted is information lost. Daily note is ephemeral; memory and tasks are durable.

If you skipped any, go back and create tasks NOW before proceeding.

## 3. Today's Focus

Populate the `## Focus` section with priority dashboard and task recommendations. This is the FIRST thing the user sees after frontmatter.

### 3.1: Load Task Data

```python
mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__list_tasks(limit=100)
```

Parse task data from output to identify:

- Priority distribution (P0/P1/P2/P3 counts)
- Overdue tasks (negative days_until_due)
- Today's work by project
- Blocked tasks

### 3.1.5: Generate Task Tree

After loading task data, generate the ASCII task tree for the `## Task Tree` section:

```python
mcp__plugin_aops-tools_task_manager__get_task_tree(
    exclude_status=["done", "cancelled"],
    max_depth=2
)
```

This provides a bird's eye view of active project hierarchy. The tree:
- Excludes completed and cancelled tasks
- Shows up to 2 levels deep (roots + children + grandchildren)
- Displays task ID, title, and status

**Format in daily note**:

```markdown
## Task Tree

```
[project-id] Project Name (status)
  [task-id] Task title (status)
    [subtask-id] Subtask title (status)
```

*Active projects with depth 2, excluding done/cancelled tasks*
```

Copy the `formatted` field from the response directly into the code block.

### 3.1.7: Query Pending Decisions

Count tasks awaiting user decisions (for decision queue summary):

```python
# Get waiting tasks assigned to user
waiting_tasks = mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__list_tasks(
    status="waiting",
    assignee="nic",
    limit=50
)

# Get review tasks assigned to user
review_tasks = mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__list_tasks(
    status="review",
    assignee="nic",
    limit=50
)

# Filter to decision-type tasks (exclude project/epic/goal)
EXCLUDED_TYPES = ["project", "epic", "goal"]
decisions = [
    t for t in (waiting_tasks + review_tasks)
    if t.type not in EXCLUDED_TYPES
]

# Get topology for blocking counts
topology = mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__get_tasks_with_topology()

# Count high-priority decisions (blocking 2+ tasks)
high_priority_count = sum(
    1 for d in decisions
    if get_blocking_count(d.id, topology) >= 2
)

decision_count = len(decisions)
```

This count appears in the Focus section summary.

### 3.2: Build Focus Section

The Focus section combines priority dashboard AND task recommendations in ONE place.

**Format** (all within `## Focus`):

```markdown
## Focus

```
P0 ░░░░░░░░░░  3/85  → No specific tasks tracked
P1 █░░░░░░░░░  12/85 → [ns-abc] [[OSB-PAO]] (-3d), [ns-def] [[ADMS-Clever]] (-16d)
P2 ██████████  55/85
P3 ██░░░░░░░░  15/85
```

**Pending Decisions**: 4 (2 blocking other work) → `/decision-extract`

🚨 **DEADLINE TODAY**: [ns-xyz] [[ARC FT26 Reviews]] - Due 23:59 AEDT (8 reviews)
**SHOULD**: [ns-abc] [[OSB PAO 2025E Review]] - 3 days overdue
**SHOULD**: [ns-def] [[ADMS Clever Reporting]] - 16 days overdue
**DEEP**: [ns-ghi] [[Write TJA paper]] - Advances ARC Future Fellowship research goals
**ENJOY**: [ns-jkl] [[Internet Histories article]] - [[Jeff Lazarus]] invitation on Santa Clara Principles
**QUICK**: [ns-mno] [[ARC COI declaration]] - Simple form completion
**UNBLOCK**: [ns-pqr] Framework CI - Address ongoing GitHub Actions failures

*Suggested sequence*: Tackle overdue items first (OSB PAO highest priority given 3-day delay, then ADMS Clever).
```

### 3.3: Reason About Recommendations

Select ~10 recommendations using judgment (approx 2 per category):

**🚨 DEADLINE TODAY (CRITICAL - always check first)**:

- Tasks with `due` date matching TODAY (within 24h)
- Format: `🚨 **DEADLINE TODAY**: [id] [[Title]] - Due HH:MM TZ (detail)`
- This category is NON-OPTIONAL - if ANY task has `due` within 24h, it MUST appear first
- Even if task seems low priority, imminent deadline overrides priority ranking

**SHOULD (deadline/commitment pressure)**:

- Check `days_until_due` - negative = overdue
- Priority: overdue → due this week → P0 without dates (note: "due today" now goes to DEADLINE TODAY)

**DEEP (long-term goal advancement)**:

- Tasks linked to strategic objectives or major project milestones
- Look for: research, design, architecture, foundational work
- Prefer tasks that advance bigger goals, not just maintain status quo
- Avoid immediate deadlines (prefer >7 days out or no deadline)

**ENJOY (variety/energy)**:

- Check `todays_work` - if one project has 3+ items, recommend different project
- Look for: papers, research, creative tasks
- Avoid immediate deadlines (prefer >7 days out)

**QUICK (momentum builder)**:

- Simple tasks: `subtasks_total` = 0 or 1
- Title signals: approve, send, confirm, respond, check
- Aim for <15 min

**UNBLOCK (remove impediments)**:

- Tasks that unblock other work or team members
- Infrastructure/tooling improvements, blocked issues
- Technical debt slowing down current work

**Framework work warning**: If `academicOps`/`aops` has 3+ items in `todays_work`:

1. Note: "Heavy framework day - consider actual tasks"
2. ENJOY must be non-framework work

### 3.4: Engage User on Priorities

After presenting recommendations, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm priorities:

- "What sounds right for today?"
- Offer to adjust recommendations based on user context

**IMPORTANT**: User's response states their PRIORITY for the day. This goes into the daily note's Focus section. It is NOT a command to execute those tasks. After recording the priority:

1. Update the Focus section with user's stated priority
2. Run auto-sync (Section 4, steps 4.1-4.7) to update daily note with session progress
3. Output: "Daily planning complete. Use `/pull` to start work."
4. HALT - do not proceed to task execution

### 3.5: Present candidate tasks to archive

```
- [ns-xyz] **[[Stale Task]]** - [reason: no activity in X days]
```

Ask: "Any of these ready to archive?"

When user picks, use `mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__update_task(id="<id>", status="cancelled")` to archive.

### 4. Daily progress (Sync)

Update daily note from session JSON files.

**Invocation**:
- **Auto-sync**: Runs automatically as part of Morning/Refresh modes (steps 4.1-4.7, skips 4.8 approval)
- **Full sync**: `/daily sync` runs section 4 only with user approval (4.8)

**Incremental behavior**: Each sync run is additive—it processes only NEW session JSONs since the last sync. Previously processed sessions are identified by their presence in the Session Log table.

### Step 4.1: Find Session JSONs

```bash
ls $ACA_DATA/../sessions/summaries/YYYYMMDD*.json 2>/dev/null
```

**Incremental filtering**: After listing JSONs, read the current daily note's Session Log table. Extract session IDs already present. Filter the JSON list to exclude already-processed sessions. This prevents duplicate entries on repeated syncs.

### Step 4.1.5: Load Closure History

Fetch recently completed tasks to provide context for today's story synthesis:

```python
mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__list_tasks(status="done", limit=20)
```

**Purpose**: Completed tasks represent work that may not appear in session JSONs (e.g., tasks completed in previous sessions, or completed without a dedicated session). This context enriches the daily narrative.

**Extract from completed tasks**:

- Issue ID, title, and project
- Closure date
- Brief description if available

**Deduplication**: Closed issues that also appear as session accomplishments should be mentioned once (prefer session context which has richer detail).

### Step 4.2: Load and Merge Sessions

Read each session JSON. Extract:

- Session ID, project, summary
- Accomplishments
- Timeline entries
- Skill compliance metrics
- Framework feedback: workflow_improvements, jit_context_needed, context_distractions, user_mood

### Step 4.3: Verify Descriptions

**CRITICAL**: Gemini mining may hallucinate. Cross-check accomplishment descriptions against actual changes (git log, file content). Per AXIOMS #2, do not propagate fabricated descriptions.

### Step 4.4: Update Daily Note Sections

Using **Edit tool** (not Write) to preserve existing content:

**Today's Story**: Synthesize narrative from session summaries AND closed issues.

- Format in dot points, but use prose to provide detail
- Include recently closed issues from Step 4.1.5 as context (e.g., "Closed [ns-xyz] completing the X feature")
- Deduplicate: If a closed issue also appears as a session accomplishment, mention it once with session context

**Session Log**: Add/update session entries.

**Session Timeline**: Build from conversation_flow timestamps.

**Project Accomplishments**: Add `[x]` items under project headers.

**Progress metrics** per project:

- **Scheduled**: Tasks with `scheduled: YYYY-MM-DD` matching today
- **Unscheduled**: Accomplishments not matching scheduled tasks
- Format: `Scheduled: ██████░░░░ 6/10 | Unscheduled: 3 items`

### Step 4.4.5: Generate Goals vs. Achieved Reflection

If the daily note contains a goals section (e.g., "## Things I want to achieve today", "## Focus", or similar), generate a reflection comparing stated intentions against actual outcomes.

**Check for goals section**: Look for sections like:
- `## Things I want to achieve today`
- `## Focus` (the task recommendations from morning planning)
- `## Today's Work Queue` (scheduled tasks)

**For each stated goal/priority**:
1. Check if corresponding work appears in session accomplishments
2. Check if related tasks were completed (from Step 4.1.5)
3. Classify as: ✅ Achieved | ⚠️ Partially/Spawned | ❌ Not achieved

**Generate reflection section**:

```markdown
## Reflection: Goals vs. Achieved

**Goals from "[section name]":**

| Goal | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| [Goal 1] | ✅ Achieved | Completed in session [id] |
| [Goal 2] | ⚠️ Partially | Task created but no completion data |
| [Goal 3] | ❌ Not achieved | No matching work found |

**Unplanned work that consumed the day:**
- [Major unplanned item] (~Xh) - [brief explanation]

**Key insight**: [One-sentence observation about drift, priorities, or patterns]
```

**Purpose**: This reflection reveals intention drift and helps understand why plans diverge from reality. Tracking "unplanned work that consumed the day" explains goal displacement.

### Step 4.5: Task Matching (Session → Task Sync)

Match session accomplishments to related tasks using semantic search.

**Per spec** ([[archived/specs/session-sync-user-story.md|session-sync-user-story]]): The agent receives accomplishments + candidate task files and decides which tasks match. Agent-driven matching, NOT algorithmic.

**4.5.1: Search for Candidate Tasks**

For each accomplishment from session JSONs:

```python
# Semantic search via memory server
candidates = mcp__memory__retrieve_memory(
    query=accomplishment_text,
    limit=5,
    similarity_threshold=0.6
)
```

**4.5.2: Agent-Driven Matching Decision**

For each accomplishment with candidates:

1. **High confidence match** (agent is certain):
   - Accomplishment clearly relates to a specific task
   - Example: "Implemented session-sync" matches task "Add session-end sync feature"
   - Action: Update task file (Step 4.6) + add task link to daily.md

2. **Low confidence match** (possible but uncertain):
   - Accomplishment might relate to a task but agent is unsure
   - Action: Note in daily.md as "possibly related to [[task]]?" - NO task file update

3. **No match** (no relevant candidates):
   - Accomplishment in daily.md only, no link
   - Action: Continue to next accomplishment

**Matching heuristics**:
- Prefer no match over wrong match (conservative)
- Consider task title, body, project alignment
- "Implemented X" accomplishment matches "Add X feature" or "X" task
- Framework work → framework tasks; project work → project tasks

**4.5.3: Graceful Degradation**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Memory server unavailable | Skip semantic matching, continue processing |
| Task file not found | Log warning, continue to next |
| Unexpected task format | Skip that task, log warning |

### Step 4.6: Update Task Files (Cross-Linking)

For each **high-confidence match** from Step 4.5:

**4.6.1: Update Task Checklist**

If accomplishment matches a specific checklist item in the task:

```markdown
# Before
- [ ] Implement feature X

# After
- [x] Implement feature X [completion:: 2026-01-19]
```

Use Edit tool to add `[x]` and `[completion:: YYYY-MM-DD]`.

**Constraints**:
- ✅ Mark sub-task checklist items complete
- ❌ NEVER mark parent tasks complete automatically
- ❌ NEVER delete any task content

**4.6.2: Append Progress Section**

Add progress note to task file body:

```markdown
## Progress

- 2026-01-19: [accomplishment text]. See [[sessions/20260119-daily.md]]
```

If `## Progress` section exists, append to it. Otherwise, create it at end of task body.

**4.6.3: Update Daily.md Cross-Links**

In the Project Accomplishments section, add task links:

```markdown
### [[academicOps]] → [[projects/aops]]

- [x] Implemented session-sync → [[tasks/inbox/ns-whue-impl-aggregate-session-insights-to-dailymd.md]]
- [x] Fixed authentication bug (possibly related to [[tasks/inbox/ns-abc-auth-refactor.md]]?)
- [x] Added new endpoint (no task match)
```

### Step 4.7: Update synthesis.json

Write `$ACA_DATA/dashboard/synthesis.json`:

```json
{
  "generated": "ISO timestamp",
  "date": "YYYYMMDD",
  "sessions": {
    "total": N,
    "by_project": {"aops": 2, "writing": 1},
    "recent": [{"session_id": "...", "project": "...", "summary": "..."}]
  },
  "narrative": ["Session summary 1", "Session summary 2"],
  "accomplishments": {
    "count": N,
    "summary": "brief text",
    "items": [{"project": "aops", "item": "Completed X"}]
  },
  "next_action": {"task": "P0 task", "reason": "Highest priority"},
  "alignment": {"status": "on_track|blocked|drifted", "note": "..."},
  "waiting_on": [{"task": "...", "blocker": "..."}],
  "skill_insights": {
    "compliance_rate": 0.75,
    "top_context_gaps": [],
    "workflow_improvements": [],
    "jit_context_needed": [],
    "context_distractions": [],
    "avg_user_tone": 0.0
  },
  "session_timeline": [{"time": "10:15", "session": "...", "activity": "..."}]
}
```

### Step 4.8: User Approval of Synthesis (Full Sync Only)

**Mode check**: Skip this step entirely when running as auto-sync (part of Morning/Refresh modes). Auto-sync processes session data silently without interrupting the flow.

**For Full Sync mode** (`/daily sync`): Do NOT consider daily progress sync complete without user approval.

After updating the daily note and synthesis.json, present a summary to the user for approval:

**4.8.1: Present Synthesis Summary**

Output the key synthesized content for review:

```markdown
## Daily Progress Synthesis - Review Required

**Today's Story** (synthesized narrative):
> [The narrative text from Today's Story section]

**Sessions Processed**: [N] sessions across [projects]

**Accomplishments** ([count] items):
- [First 3-5 accomplishments listed]
- ...

**Task Matches Made**:
- [List of high-confidence task matches, if any]
```

**4.8.2: Request Approval**

Use `AskUserQuestion` to get explicit approval:

```python
AskUserQuestion(
    questions=[{
        "question": "Does this synthesis accurately capture today's progress?",
        "header": "Synthesis",
        "options": [
            {"label": "Looks good", "description": "Synthesis is accurate, proceed to save"},
            {"label": "Needs edits", "description": "I'll make manual corrections to the daily note"},
            {"label": "Regenerate", "description": "Re-run synthesis with different approach"}
        ],
        "multiSelect": false
    }]
)
```

**4.8.3: Handle Response**

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "Looks good" | Proceed to completion, output "Daily sync complete." |
| "Needs edits" | Output "Daily note ready for your edits at [path]. Run `/daily` again after editing to re-sync." HALT without marking complete. |
| "Regenerate" | Ask what should change, then re-run Steps 4.4-4.7 |

**Rationale**: Per AXIOM #3 (Don't Make Shit Up), Gemini-mined accomplishments may contain inaccuracies. User approval catches hallucinations before they persist in the daily record.

## Error Handling

- **Outlook unavailable**: Skip email triage, continue with recommendations
- **No session JSONs**: Skip sync, note "No sessions to sync"
- **No tasks**: Present empty state, offer to run `/tasks`
- **Memory server unavailable**: Skip semantic task matching (Step 4.5), continue with daily.md updates
- **Task file not found**: Log warning "Task file missing: {path}", continue to next accomplishment
- **Unexpected task format**: Log warning "Skipping task {id}: unexpected format", continue processing

## Daily Note Structure (SSoT)

See the note template at `aops-core/skills/daily/references/note-template.md` (relative to $AOPS)
or `[[references/note-template]]` (Obsidian wikilink) for the complete daily note template.
