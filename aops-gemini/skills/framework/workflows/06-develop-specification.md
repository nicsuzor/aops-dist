# Workflow 6: Develop Automation Specification

**When**: User wants to automate a manual process or you've identified a good automation candidate.

**Purpose**: Collaboratively develop a complete task specification using TASK-SPEC-TEMPLATE.md before implementation begins.

**Steps**:

1. **Identify automation target**
   - User describes manual process causing pain
   - Or: Agent observes repeated manual work and suggests automation
   - Confirm this is actual pain point worth automating

1. **Create specification document**
   - Copy `$AOPS/aops-core/skills/framework/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md` to working location
   - Name: `$AOPS/specs/[descriptive-name].md`
   - This is a collaborative working document

1. **Fill Problem Statement section (collaborative)**
   - **Agent asks**: "What manual work are we automating?"
   - **Agent asks**: "Why does this matter?" (time saved, quality gains)
   - **Agent asks**: "Who benefits and how?"
   - Write clear, specific answers

1. **Define Acceptance Criteria (collaborative, USER-OWNED)**
   - **CRITICAL**: These criteria define "done" and are user-owned (agents cannot modify them)
   - **Before writing criteria**: Consult [[skills/qa/references/qa-planning.md]] — write qualitative dimensions (questions requiring judgment) anchored to user stories, not binary checklists. Define what excellent and poor look like for each dimension.
   - **Agent writes**: Persona paragraph — inhabit the user's situation when they encounter this feature (cognitive/emotional state, constraints, what success feels like)
   - **Agent asks**: "How will we know this automation succeeded?" — frame answers as qualitative dimensions, not pass/fail checks
   - **Agent asks**: "What would indicate this implementation is WRONG?"
   - **Agent asks**: "What quality threshold is acceptable?" — describe the spectrum from excellent to poor
   - Write 3-5 qualitative acceptance criteria with quality spectra (per QA Planning guidance)
   - Write 2-3 failure modes that indicate wrong implementation
   - Write regression checks (binary guards against breakage, separate from qualitative acceptance)
   - **Agent confirms**: "Regression checks will be implemented as automated tests. Qualitative criteria will be evaluated narratively. Agents cannot modify these criteria."

1. **Scope the work (collaborative)**
   - **Agent proposes**: Initial scope based on problem statement
   - **Agent asks**: "What's explicitly out of scope?"
   - Keep scope minimal and focused
   - Define clear boundaries
   - **Agent asks**: "Does this feel like one focused task?"

1. **Identify dependencies**
   - **Agent checks**: What infrastructure must exist first?
   - **Agent checks**: What data is required?
   - **Agent asks**: "What happens if dependencies are missing?"
   - Document error handling (fail-fast, no silent failures)

1. **Design integration test (collaborative, CRITICAL)**
   - **CRITICAL**: Tests IMPLEMENT acceptance criteria from step 5, not new criteria
   - **Agent proposes**: Test approach that validates EACH acceptance criterion
   - Map each test to specific acceptance criterion: "Test 1 validates criterion #1"
   - Walk through: Setup → Execute → Validate → Cleanup
   - **Agent asks**: "How do we prove EACH acceptance criterion is met?"
   - **Agent asks**: "How do we detect EACH failure mode?"
   - Write concrete test steps before any implementation
   - Test must be designed to fail initially
   - **Verify**: Every acceptance criterion has corresponding test

1. **Plan implementation approach**
   - **Agent proposes**: High-level technical design
   - Identify components and data flow
   - Justify technology choices
   - **Agent asks**: "What could go wrong?" (failure modes)
   - Document error handling strategy

1. **Assess effort and risk**
   - **Agent estimates**: Time required for each phase
   - Identify risks and mitigations
   - **Agent asks**: "Are we confident in this estimate?"
   - Flag any open questions that need resolution

1. **Review and refine**
   - **Agent reads back**: Complete specification summary
   - **Agent asks**: "Does this feel right? Anything missing?"
   - Iterate on any unclear or incomplete sections

1. **Finalize specification**
   - Move completed spec to `$AOPS/specs/` (AUTHORITATIVE location)
   - Specification is now the contract for implementation
   - Ready to proceed with workflow 01 (Design New Component)

**Output**:

- Complete specification document ready for implementation
- User-owned acceptance criteria (observable, testable, cannot be modified by agents)
- Integration tests that implement each acceptance criterion
- Identified dependencies and risks
- User confident in scope and approach

**Verification before proceeding**:

- [ ] Acceptance criteria section complete (Success Tests + Failure Modes)
- [ ] Each acceptance criterion is observable and testable
- [ ] Integration test design maps to each criterion
- [ ] User confirms these criteria define "done"
