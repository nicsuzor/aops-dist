# Hierarchy Quality Rules (P#73)

To prevent task map fragmentation and orphan tasks, all task creation MUST adhere to these structural rules.

## Rule 1: Mandatory Parent Linkage

Every non-root task created with a `project` MUST have a `parent` set. Root-level project and goal tasks are exempt (they are the hierarchy entry points).

- If the task is part of an epic, set `parent: <epic-id>`.
- If the task is a new workstream, set `parent: <project-id>`.
- **Never** set `parent: null` for a regular task when a project is known.

## Rule 2: The WHY Test

Every task MUST answer: **"Why does this exist in the context of its parent?"**
If you can't articulate the purpose in terms of the parent's goals, the task is either misplaced or missing an intermediate epic.

## Rule 3: Match Type to Scale

- **EPIC**: Multi-session work toward a milestone.
- **TASK**: Discrete deliverable (1-4 hours).
- **ACTION**: Single work session step (< 30 minutes).

## Rule 4: Star Pattern Prevention

Avoid nodes with > 5 direct children. If a project or epic has too many children, group related tasks under new intermediate epics.

## Parent Resolution Protocol

Before calling `create_task`, resolve the correct `parent` using this fallback chain:

1. **Current task context** — If executing under a claimed task, read its parent epic and use that.
2. **Active epics** — Query the project for active epics and select the most relevant:
   `mcp__pkb__list_tasks(project="<project>", type="epic", status="active")`
3. **Project root** — If no matching epic exists, use the project root task as parent.
4. **Ask user** — If no project is known, ask before creating the task.

This protocol is the canonical procedure. Call sites must reference `[[references/hierarchy-quality-rules]]` rather than re-implementing it.
