# Handover Details and Edge Cases

Detailed procedures for specific handover activities and handling unusual situations.

## Quick Exit: No Work Done

If the session only involved answering user questions with no code changes, task work, or meaningful framework work:

```markdown
## Framework Reflection

User asked: "<brief summary of question/topic>"
Answer: "<summary of answer>"
Next steps: "<what the user or agent should do next, including task ID if applicable>"
```

Then **stop** - skip all other steps.

## Step 3: File Follow-up Tasks

If outstanding work remains, file follow-up tasks using [[decompose]] principles:

- **Group related items** into a single task with bullet points — don't create one task per TODO
- **Appropriate granularity**: each task should be a coherent work unit (≤4h, single "why"), not an individual checklist item
- **No reflexive tasks**: only create tasks where the action path is clear
- **Include context**: body should contain enough for the next agent to resume without re-reading the session
- **Completion loop (P#109)**: If creating multiple follow-up subtasks under a parent, also create a verify-parent task that depends on all of them to close the loop

```python
mcp__pkb__create_task(
  title="<coherent work unit>",
  type="task",
  project="<project>",
  priority=2,
  body="Follow-up from <session>. Context: <what needs doing and why>",
  parent="<parent-task-id>"
)
```

## Step 4: Persist to Memory

For each task complete and learning to persist:

```python
mcp__pkb__create_memory(
  title="Session handover: <brief summary>",
  body="<work done and key learnings>",
  tags=["dump", "handover"]
)
```

## Step 5: Reflection Template (AGENTS.md Format)

Output the reflection in **exact AGENTS.md format**:

```markdown
## Framework Reflection

**Prompts**: [Original request in brief]
**Guidance received**: [Hydrator/custodiet advice, or "N/A"]
**Followed**: [Yes/No/Partial - explain]
**Outcome**: [success/partial]
**Accomplishments**: [What was accomplished]
**Friction points**: [What caused hurdles or dump]
**Root cause**: [Why work couldn't complete]
**Proposed changes**: [Framework improvements identified]
**Next step**: [Exact context for next session to resume, including Task ID]
```

## Edge Cases

### No task currently claimed BUT work was completed

CREATE a historical task to capture the session's work:

```python
mcp__pkb__create_task(
  title="[Session] <brief description of work done>",
  type="task",
  project="<relevant project or 'aops'>",
  status="done",
  priority=3,
  body="Historical task created at /dump.\n\n## Work Completed\n<what was accomplished>\n\n## Outcome\n<success/partial/failed>\n\n## Context\n<any follow-up notes>"
)
```

### Blocked by infrastructure bug (P#9/P#25)

When session ends because tooling failed and a bug was filed:

1. **Mark original task as blocked**:

```python
mcp__pkb__update_task(
  id="<original-task-id>",
  status="blocked",
  depends_on=["<bug-task-id>"]
)
```

2. **Reflection outcome**: `partial` with friction point explaining the infrastructure failure

3. **Do NOT leave task as "active"** - blocked tasks should be visible as blocked, not appear claimed
