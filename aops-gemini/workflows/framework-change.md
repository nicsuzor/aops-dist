# Framework Change

Governance modifications requiring justification and escalation.

## Routing Signals

Modifying:

- AXIOMS.md, HEURISTICS.md
- framework/enforcement-map.md
- hooks/*.py
- settings.json deny rules

## NOT This Workflow

- User data, session artifacts, task updates → standard workflows
- Non-governance code → [[design]]

## Unique Steps

1. Load context: AXIOMS, HEURISTICS, enforcement-map
2. Search prior art
3. Emit structured justification
4. Route for approval (see escalation)
5. CHECKPOINT: Wait for approval
6. Make change exactly as justified
7. Update enforcement-map.md

## Escalation Matrix

| Change Type           | Escalation |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| Corollary to existing | auto       |
| New heuristic         | critic     |
| New axiom             | human      |
| Enforcement hook      | critic     |
| Deny rule             | human      |
