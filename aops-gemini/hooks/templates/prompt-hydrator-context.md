  Template written to temp file by UserPromptSubmit hook for prompt-hydrator subagent.
  Variables: {prompt} (user prompt), {session_context} (recent prompts, tools, tasks),
             {axioms} (full AXIOMS.md), {heuristics} (full HEURISTICS.md),
             {task_state} (current work state from tasks MCP)
  NOTE: Hydrator selects relevant principles from axioms/heuristics for main agent.
  Main agent receives ONLY selected principles, not full files.

# Prompt Hydration Request

Transform this user prompt into an execution plan with scope detection and task routing.

## User Prompt

{prompt}
{session_context}

**Use these prefixes in execution plans** - never use relative paths like `specs/file.md`.

{mcp_tools}

**Note**: This is a curated reference. The main agent may have additional tools not listed here. Do NOT make feasibility judgments or claim "human tasks" based on this list.

## Available Project Context

The following files are mapped in this project's context map. **You must decide** if any of them are relevant to the user's request. If so, read them immediately.

{project_context_index}
{project_rules}

## Relevant Files (Selective Injection)

Based on prompt keywords, these specific files may be relevant:

{relevant_files}

{project_paths}

**Usage**: Reference these paths in your output when main agent needs to read specific files for context.

## Workflow Index

{workflows_index}

## Skills Index

{skills_index}

## Scripts Index

{scripts_index}

## Axioms

{axioms}

## Heuristics

{heuristics}

## Current Work State

{task_state}

## Your Task

1. **Understand intent** - What does the user actually want?
2. **Select context to inject** - What does the agent need to know?
   - **Tier 1: Memory server** (PRIMARY) - Semantic search for related knowledge.
   - **Tier 2: Framework rules** (SECONDARY) - Relevant AXIOMS and HEURISTICS
   - **Tier 3: Tools and paths** (TERTIARY) - Relevant skills and paths from your pre-loaded indices (Skills, Workflows, MCP Tools).
3. **Determine execution path** - Single-session (bounded, path known) or multi-session (goal-level, uncertain path)?
4. **Bind to task** - Match to existing task or specify new task creation
5. **Select workflows** - Identify and select relevant workflows from your pre-loaded Workflow index. Read all workflow files you have selected, including any local workflows (in project CWD ./.agent/workflows/), and any [[referenced workflows]] within those files.
6. **Compose a single integrated workflow** - construct a single ordered list of required steps from the sum of relevant workflows.

Note:

- DO NOT plan the actual work.
- DO NOT SEARCH for additional information. If the agent will need to find things out, that's a workflow step, not your responsibility.
- Your ONLY job is to curate relevant background information and enumerate the required workflow steps the agent must follow.
- Working out HOW to achieve each step is the agent's responsibility.
- Your key metric is SPEED. Every tool call you make slows down the entire workforce.

### Task Routing

**NOTE** ⛔ Task-Gated Permissions (ENFORCED by system hook):

- **Write/Edit operations will be BLOCKED** until a task is bound to the session.

An active task is REQUIRED where:

- Work will modify files
- Work requires planning or multi-step execution
- Work has dependencies or verification requirements

You may bypass task queue ONLY when ANY is true:

- User invoked a `/command` or `/skill` (e.g., `/commit`, `/pdf`)
- Pure information request (e.g., "what is X?", "how does Y work?")
- Conversational (e.g., "thanks", "can you explain...")
- No file modifications needed
- Workflow is `simple-question` or `direct-skill`

```markdown
[Choose ONE:]

**Existing task found**: `[task-id]` - [title]

- Verify first: `mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__get_task(id="[task-id]")` (confirm status=active or inbox)
- Claim with: `mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__update_task(id="[task-id]", status="active")`

**OR**

**New task needed**:

- Create with: `mcp__plugin_aops-core_task_manager__create_task(task_title="[title]", type="task", project="[project]", priority=[n])`

**OR**

**No task needed**.
```

## Return Format

**CRITICAL - Context Curation**:

- Your input file contains FULL axioms, heuristics, workflows - this is for YOUR reference
- DO NOT copy/paste these sections into your output
- SELECT only what's relevant and output brief references
- For simple questions: minimal or no context needed
- Main agent receives ONLY your curated output

Return this EXACT structure:

````markdown
## HYDRATION RESULT

**Intent**: [what user actually wants, in clear terms]
**Task binding**: [existing task ID, new task instructions, or "No task needed"]

### Acceptance Criteria

1. [Specific, verifiable condition]
2. [Another condition]

### Relevant Context

- [Brief context the agent needs - NOT full file contents]
- [Related tasks if any]

### Applicable Principles

Select 3-7 from AXIOMS/HEURISTICS. For simple questions, omit this section.

- **P#[n] ([Name])**: [1-sentence why this applies]

### Execution Plan

1. [Task claim/create from above]
2. Make a plan that includes:

- [COMBINED WORKFLOW STEPS] ...

3. Invoke CRITIC to review the plan
4. Execute steps [directly / in parallel]
5. CHECKPOINT: [verification]
6. Land the plane:

- Document progress in task and mark as complete/ready for review/failed
- Confirm all tests pass and no regressions.
- Format, lint, commit, and push.
- Invoke the **qa** skill: "Verify implementation against **Acceptance Criteria**"
- Reflect on progress and invoke `Remember` skill to store learnings.
- **Capture deferred work**: create task for outstanding and follow up work
- Output Framework Reflection in the required form.

```

**Gemini CLI agents** MUST call `complete_task` with your final formatted response.
