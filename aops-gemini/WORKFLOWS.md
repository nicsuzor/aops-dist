# Workflow Index

Workflows are **hydrator hints**, not complete instructions. They tell the hydrator:

1. When this workflow applies (routing signals)
2. What's unique to this workflow
3. Which base workflows to compose

## Base Workflows (Composable Patterns)

**Always consider these.** Most workflows compose one or more base patterns.

| Base                    | Pattern                                         | Skip When                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [[base-task-tracking]]  | Claim/create task, update progress, complete    | [[simple-question]], direct skill    |
| [[base-tdd]]            | Red-green-refactor cycle                        | Non-code changes                     |
| [[base-verification]]   | Checkpoint before completion                    | Trivial changes                      |
| [[base-commit]]         | Stage, commit (why not what), push              | No file modifications                |
| [[base-handover]]       | Session end: task, git push, reflection         | [[simple-question]]                  |
| [[base-memory-capture]] | Store findings to memory MCP via /remember      | No discoveries, [[simple-question]]  |
| [[base-qa]]             | QA checkpoint: lock criteria, gather, judge     | Trivial changes, user waives         |
| [[base-batch]]          | Batch processing: chunk, parallelize, aggregate | Single item, items have dependencies |
| [[base-investigation]]  | Investigation: hypothesis -> probe -> conclude  | Cause known, just executing          |

## Decision Tree

**Multiple intents?** If your prompt contains two or more distinct goals (e.g., "process emails AND fix that bug"), split and route each independently. One workflow per intent.

## Scope-Based Routing

| Signal                                         | Route to                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "Write a paper", "Build X", "Plan the project" | [[decompose]]                               |
| "Add feature X", "Fix bug Y" (clear steps)     | [[feature-dev]]                             |
| "Bug broken", "not working" (cause unknown)    | [[base-investigation]] + task-tracking      |
| "How do I..." (information only)               | [[simple-question]]                         |
| "Process all X", "batch update"                | [[base-batch]]                              |
| "Process emails", "check inbox"                | [[email-triage]]                            |
| "Review grant", "reference letter"             | [[peer-review]] / [[reference-letter]]      |
| "/commit", "/email" (skill name)               | [[simple-question]] + invoke skill directly |

## Project-Specific Workflows

Projects can extend the global workflow catalog by defining local workflows in the project root:

1. **Local Index**: `.agent/WORKFLOWS.md`
   - If present, its content can be included in the hydration context during the `UserPromptSubmit` hook.
   - Use this for project-wide workflow routing and definitions.

2. **Workflow Directory**: `.agent/workflows/*.md`
   - Individual workflow files.
   - **Content Injection**: During the `UserPromptSubmit` hook, the orchestration layer may include the content of these files in the hydrator context if the prompt matches the filename (e.g., "manual-qa" matches `manual-qa.md`).
   - Use these for specific, repetitive procedures unique to the project.

## Key Distinctions

| If you're unsure between...            | Ask...                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [[decompose]] vs [[feature-dev]]       | "Figure out what to do" vs "design how to do it"    |
| [[simple-question]] vs [[feature-dev]] | Pure info (no file mods) vs any file-modifying work |
| [[qa]] modes                           | Quick verification vs acceptance vs integration     |
