# Workflow Index

<!-- @nic: general rule: self-documenting files are good, but documentation should NOT be in template text that goes to a LLM. We EITHER have to delineate this markdown or move it into the frontmatter or spec file.  -->
<!-- @claude 2026-01-24: This file is type:index - it's for human reference and hydrator routing, not direct LLM injection. Individual workflow files (e.g., workflows/design.md) are what get loaded. Those should stay lean. This index can remain self-documenting. -->
<!-- @nic 2026-01-26: bullshit. this file is directly injected. reconsider. -->
<!-- @claude 2026-02-07: You're right - this file IS loaded by user_prompt_submit.py via load_workflows_index(). Task created: aops-25545fb8. Options: (1) Move explanatory content to a separate docs file, keeping only the routing table here, or (2) use frontmatter-only format like other indices. Recommend option 1. -->

Workflows are **hydrator hints**, not complete instructions. They tell the hydrator:

1. When this workflow applies (routing signals)
2. What's unique to this workflow
3. Which base workflows to compose

> **Design note (2026-01-25)**: The former `minor-edit` workflow was removed. Any file-modifying work requires full hydration planning—there is no "minor edit" category. Pure information requests route to `simple-question`; all file modifications route to `design` or more specific workflows.

## Base Workflows (Composable Patterns)

**Always consider these.** Most workflows compose one or more base patterns.

| Base                   | Pattern                                      | Skip When                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [[base-task-tracking]] | Claim/create task, update progress, complete | [[simple-question]], [[direct-skill]] |
| [[base-tdd]]           | Red-green-refactor cycle                     | Non-code changes                      |
| [[base-verification]]  | Checkpoint before completion                 | Trivial changes                       |
| [[base-commit]]        | Stage, commit (why not what), push           | No file modifications                 |

## Scope-Based Routing

| Signal                                         | Route to             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| "Write a paper", "Build X", "Plan the project" | [[decompose]]        |
| "Add feature X", "Fix bug Y" (clear steps)     | [[design]]           |
| "How do I..." (information only)               | [[simple-question]]  |
| "Process all X", "batch update"                | [[batch-processing]] |
| "/commit", "/email" (skill name)               | [[direct-skill]]     |

## Key Distinctions

| If you're unsure between...          | Ask...                                              |

| [[decompose]] vs [[design]]          | "Figure out what to do" vs "design how to do it"    |
| [[qa-demo]] vs [[prove-feature]]     | "Does it run?" vs "Does it integrate correctly?"    |
| [[simple-question]] vs [[design]]    | Pure info (no file mods) vs any file-modifying work |
| [[simple-question]] vs [[debugging]] | Pure info vs leads to investigation                 |
