# Audit Report

## Executive Summary

High-level findings and overall status. Brief description of what was audited, major findings, and recommendations.

### Structure Audit Results

- Missing from INDEX.md: skills/foo/
- Broken wikilinks: [[nonexistent.md]] in X.md

### Justification Matrix

**Justified** (N files) - spec exists:

- AXIOMS.md → specs/meta-framework.md
- hooks/user_prompt_submit.py → specs/prompt-enricher.md

**Implicit** (N files) - in docs, no dedicated spec:

- FRAMEWORK-PATHS.md → JIT-INJECTION.md
- README.md → framework convention

**Orphan candidates** (N files) - no reference found:

- docs/OLD-FILE.md

### Content Violations

**Skill Content Issues**:
- skills/foo/SKILL.md:45-67 - explanatory content (move to spec)
- skills/bar/SKILL.md - 623 lines (>500 limit)

**Execution Flow Drift**:
- Hook in code, missing from diagram: unified_logger.py (PostToolUse)
- Hook in diagram, not in router.py: old_hook.py

**Hook→Axiom Mismatches**:
- Hook declares axiom but framework/enforcement-map.md shows "Prompt" level only
- Axiom has Hard/Soft Gate in framework/enforcement-map.md but no hook declares it

### Actions Taken

**Generated Indices Regenerated**:
- INDEX.md: [N] files mapped
- framework/enforcement-map.md: [N] enforcement mechanisms
- WORKFLOWS.md: [N] task types, [M] skill workflows
- README.md flowchart: [N] hooks in flow diagram

**Other Updates**:
- Updated README.md commands table
- Fixed broken wikilinks
- Added missing entries to indices

### Human Review Queue

- Orphan: docs/OLD-FILE.md - delete or create spec?
- Skill over size limit: skills/bar/SKILL.md - refactor or document exception?

### Tasks Created

Created N tasks:

- ns-xxx: [title]
- ns-yyy: [title]
```

## Validation Criteria

- README.md < 200 lines
- README.md has "How Enforcement Works" section with Mermaid diagram
- README.md Skills table has "Sub-workflows" column for skills with multiple workflows
- INDEX.md has every directory
- All `→` references resolve
- No broken `[[wikilinks]]`
- All SKILL.md files < 500 lines
- No explanatory content in SKILL.md files
- Orphan count reported (0 ideal)
- README.md flowchart matches hooks/router.py dispatch table (regenerated via flowchart skill)
- Generated indices (INDEX.md, framework/enforcement-map.md, WORKFLOWS.md) include "Generated by audit" header
- Generated indices reflect current source file state
- **Hook→Axiom accuracy**: Every hook with "Enforces:" declaration is in framework/enforcement-map.md with correct level (not just "Prompt")
- **Enforcement completeness**: Every axiom with Hard/Soft Gate in framework/enforcement-map.md has a corresponding hook with "Enforces:" declaration
- **Sub-workflow coverage**: Skills with `## Workflow:` headers or `workflows/` subdirectories have all workflows listed in README.md AND WORKFLOWS.md
