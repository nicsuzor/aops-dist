# Peer Review

Structured review for grant/fellowship applications.

## Routing Signals

- Assessment packages
- Scheme reviews (ARC FT, etc.)
- Multiple applications to evaluate

## Phases

1. **Setup**: Create workspace, get criteria, generate template
2. **Scaffold**: Create bot tasks per application (transcribe, draft, observe)
3. **Execute**: Workers process using templates
4. **Compose**: Human drafts, agent assists with voice/tone

## Composition Principles

- Tone: Professional positive, measured not effusive
- Voice: Evaluate claims, don't restate
- Evidence: Concrete examples over generalizations
- Structure: Lead with strengths, concerns at end
